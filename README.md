# -Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL
The Pizza Sales Analysis Project is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the sales performance of a pizza restaurant chain. By leveraging SQL for data extraction and analysis, this project addresses key business questions to inform strategic decision-making.
**Project Description:**
This project involves analyzing various aspects of pizza sales, including order quantities, revenue generation, product popularity, and customer ordering patterns. The analysis is conducted by executing SQL queries on the restaurant's sales database, which comprises tables such as orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types.

**Scope:**
Data Integration: Combine data from multiple tables to create a unified view of sales information.
Sales Metrics Calculation: Compute total orders placed, total revenue generated, and identify the highest-priced pizza.
Customer Preferences Analysis: Determine the most commonly ordered pizza size and the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
Category-wise Analysis: Join relevant tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered and analyze the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
Temporal Analysis: Group orders by date to calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
Revenue-Based Ranking: Identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
